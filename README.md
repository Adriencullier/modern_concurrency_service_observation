# Service Observation in modern concurrency context

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to observe services in the modern concurrency context (Swift 6, asyn/await). It leverages the latest APIs for Observation and async/await, ensuring strict adherence to contemporary Swift practices.

## Features

- Utilizes Swift 6 and Xcode 16.
- Implements strict concurrency.
- Uses the latest Observation API from Swift to observe services efficiently.
- Ensures code clarity and maintainability by adopting modern concurrency patterns.

## Problem Statement

The core problem addressed by this project is how to observe services while respecting modern concurrency patterns in Swift. By leveraging async/await and the Observation API, this project showcases best practices for handling asynchronous tasks and service observation in a clean, efficient manner.

## Prerequisites

- Xcode 16
- Swift 6
